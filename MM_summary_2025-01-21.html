<h1>Jim Cramer's Mad Money Recap</h1>
<h2>Segment 1: Market Recap and Semiconductor Stocks</h2>
<ul>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3% and turned positive for the year, driven by cooler inflation data and strong earnings reports.</li>
<li>Semiconductor stocks, such as Applied Materials and Intel, performed well due to Taiwan Semiconductor's impressive quarter, which suggests a potential turnaround in the chip industry.</li>
<li>Cramer emphasized the importance of semiconductor stocks in the current market, as they are critical components in various industries, including technology, automotive, and aerospace.</li>
<li>For retail investors, this segment suggests that semiconductor stocks may be worth considering, especially those with strong fundamentals and growth prospects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 2: Housing Market and Interest Rates</h2>
<ul>
<li>A decline in interest rates could get the housing sector back on track, as lower rates make mortgages more affordable and increase demand for housing.</li>
<li>Builder First Source and Home Depot could benefit from lower interest rates, as they are well-positioned to take advantage of an improving housing market.</li>
<li>Housing starts were up 15.8% month-over-month, exceeding expectations, which suggests that the housing market may be gaining momentum.</li>
<li>For retail investors, this segment suggests that housing-related stocks, such as homebuilders and home improvement retailers, may be worth considering, especially if interest rates continue to decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 3: Healthcare and Middlemen</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) middlemen are widely disliked in the industry, as they are seen as profiteers who drive up healthcare costs.</li>
<li>These PBM middlemen siphon off $7.3 billion in profits from the healthcare system, which is a significant burden on consumers and taxpayers.</li>
<li>The government could target these PBM middlemen to reduce healthcare costs, which could have significant implications for the healthcare industry.</li>
<li>For retail investors, this segment suggests that healthcare stocks, especially those involved in the PBM industry, may be vulnerable to regulatory changes and declining profits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 4: Lightning Round</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RGRTI:</strong> a quantum stock with potential for a short squeeze, but Cramer warned that it's a speculative play and not for the faint of heart.</li>
<li><strong>ASML:</strong> a great company with a strong track record, recommended to buy for long-term investors.</li>
<li><strong>AMD:</strong> Cramer is reluctant to buy ahead of earnings, citing concerns about demand and competition in the chip industry.</li>
<li><strong>Dow:</strong> Cramer recommends holding onto the stock, citing its dividend yield and potential for long-term growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EL:</strong> not Cramer's favorite, recommends Chewy instead, citing Chewy's strong growth prospects and competitive advantage in the pet retail industry.</li>
<li><strong>Clover Health (CLOV):</strong> a speculative stock, not recommended due to its lack of profitability and uncertain growth prospects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 5: Apple's Stock Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple's stock fell 3.2% after being downgraded by two analysts, citing concerns about demand and competition in the tech industry.</li>
<li>Cramer remains optimistic about Apple's future, citing its history of pivoting and fixing problems, as well as its growing service revenue stream.</li>
<li>For retail investors, this segment suggests that Apple's stock may be worth considering for long-term investors, despite its recent decline.</li>
<li>Cramer emphasized the importance of holding onto Apple stock for the long term, rather than trying to time the market or react to short-term fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
