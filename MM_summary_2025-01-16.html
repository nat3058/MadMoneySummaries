<h1>Jim Cramer's Show Recap</h1>
<h2>Segment 1: Strong Credit Quality Metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussion with Brian Jordan, Chairman and CEO of First Horizon, a regional bank with a strong presence in the southern United States.</li>
<li>First Horizon reported strong credit quality metrics, with low charge-offs and a growing loan pipeline.</li>
<li>Jordan expressed optimism about the economy, citing strong job growth and low unemployment.</li>
<li>First Horizon has repositioned its bond portfolio to take advantage of higher interest rates, selling $1 billion to $2 billion in securities with a 1% yield and reinvesting at a 5%+ yield.</li>
<li>The bank has also reduced its reliance on wholesale funding, which should help to improve its net interest margin.</li>
<li>Jordan believes that the regulatory environment is becoming more balanced, with a greater focus on tailoring regulations to the size and risk profile of individual banks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 2: Cybersecurity and Identity Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussion with Totman, Co-Founder and CEO of Octa, a leading provider of identity verification solutions.</li>
<li>Totman emphasized the importance of robust identity verification and security measures, citing the growing threat of cyber attacks and data breaches.</li>
<li>Octa's platform provides a neutral and independent identity verification solution that can be used across multiple industries and applications.</li>
<li>Totman believes that the demand for identity verification solutions will continue to grow, driven by the increasing need for secure and reliable identity verification.</li>
<li>The company has seen strong growth in recent quarters, with a significant increase in revenue and customer adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 3: Lightning Round</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>: Cramer believes the stock will be higher in the long term, citing the company's dominant position in e-commerce and its growing presence in cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment Healthcare (ALHC)</strong>: Cramer is not familiar with the company and advises doing more research before making a decision.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy (MSTR)</strong>: Cramer views MicroStrategy as a "super-hyped-up version of Bitcoin" and advises investors to be cautious.</li>
<li><strong>Virtu Financial (VIRT)</strong>: Cramer thinks Virtu Financial is an inexpensive fintech company with growth potential, citing its strong position in the market-making business.</li>
<li><strong>Best Buy (BBY)</strong>: Cramer believes the stock is too cheap and yields 4.5%, making it an attractive option for income investors.</li>
<li><strong>FTI (FTI)</strong>: Cramer advises holding onto the stock, citing the company's strong position in the consulting business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 4: Semiconductor Industry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taiwan Semi's blowout quarter was driven by strong demand for its chips, particularly in the areas of 5G, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.</li>
<li>The company's decision to investigate low-end US chip makers in America for dumping chips in China could have significant implications for the global semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>The Biden White House's decision to restrict high-end chip sales to certain countries could also have a major impact on the industry, particularly for companies like Nvidia that rely heavily on exports.</li>
<li>Nvidia's stock decline despite positive news from Taiwan Semi may be due to concerns about the company's exposure to the China market and the potential impact of the Biden administration's restrictions.</li>
<li>The US Chips and Science Act is a bipartisan bill aimed at boosting the US semiconductor industry, but its impact is still unclear.</li>
</ul>
