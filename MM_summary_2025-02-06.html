<h1>Mad Money Recap</h1>
<h2>Segment 1: Mad Money Podcast Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of top performers of 2025, including Roblox (RBLX), which has been a strong growth stock despite recent volatility</li>

</ul>
<h2>Segment 2: Interview with Chris Swift, CEO of The Hartford</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of The Hartford's (HIG) strong performance, including nearly doubling earnings per share over the past five years, driven by the company's disciplined underwriting and risk management</li>
<li>Swift attributed the company's success to its ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including the impact of inflation on insurance premiums</li>
<li>The Hartford's largest and most profitable business is commercial lines, which provides insurance coverage to businesses, and the company has a strong track record of generating underwriting profits in this segment</li>
<li>Swift also highlighted the company's growing presence in the group benefits market, which provides insurance coverage to employees through their employers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 3: Interview with Tarang Amin, CEO of e.l.f. Beauty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF) recent earnings report, which included a Topline beat but a small earnings miss, driven by the company's strong sales growth in the quarter</li>
<li>Amin attributed the softer January sales to industry-wide declines, promotional fatigue, and reduced social media activity, highlighting the challenges facing the beauty industry in the current environment</li>
<li>e.l.f. Beauty has a strong international business, with 66% year-over-year growth, driven by the company's successful expansion into new markets, including China and Europe</li>

</ul>
<h2>Segment 5: Interviews with Vial Kapor, CEO of Honeywell, and Renee Hos, COO of Arm Holdings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Honeywell's (HON) planned breakup into three separate businesses was initially met with enthusiasm, but the stock later fell due to a guidance shortfall, highlighting the importance of managing expectations in the market</li>
<li>Cramer believes Honeywell's breakup will create significant value, particularly in its Aerospace and Quantum Computing divisions, and notes that the company's strong track record of innovation and execution will serve it well in these markets</li>
<li>Arm Holdings has had a strong run since Cramer last recommended it, driven by the company's growing presence in the smartphone market and its expanding partnerships with major technology companies</li>
<li>Arm's relationship with Nvidia (NVDA) benefits both companies, and Cramer believes Nvidia's stock will perform well despite recent challenges, driven by the company's strong track record of innovation and execution in the artificial intelligence and graphics markets</li>
