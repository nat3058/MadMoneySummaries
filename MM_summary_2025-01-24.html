<h1>Jim Cramer's Show Recap</h1>
<h2>Segment 1: Introduction and Nebus Group Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussed Nebus Group (formerly Yandex), a company that provides AI infrastructure and services, and has partnered with Nvidia</li>
<li>Stock has soared from $4 to $41 since October, but Kramer highlights concerns:
<ul>
<li>Expensive valuation (20 times full-year revenue forecast), making it vulnerable to a correction</li>
<li>Lack of institutional support, which could limit its upside potential</li>
<li>Uncertainty over Nvidia chip access, which could impact Nebus Group's business model</li>
<li>Potential for another fundraising round, which could lead to dilution for existing shareholders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kramer concludes that he's not ready to recommend Nebus Group, suggesting buying Nvidia instead, as it's a more established company with a stronger track record</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 2: CNBC Investing Club Q&amp;A</h2>
<ul>
<li>Answered questions from club members:
<ul>
<li>Ron in Georgia: Asked about Jeffries (JEF) after its disappointing quarter; Kramer suggests selling JEF and buying Goldman Sachs (GS) instead, as GS has a stronger brand and more diversified business</li>
<li>Steve in New Jersey: Asked about ringing the register and taking profits; Kramer explains his strategy for trimming positions and taking profits, emphasizing the importance of discipline and risk management</li>
<li>Antonio: Asked about real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Realty Income (O) and V Properties; Kramer likes Realty Income for its stable dividend income and diversified portfolio, but warns that REITs can be interest-rate sensitive</li>
<li>Phil: Asked about the potential impact of rolling back credit card user fees on companies like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and Capital One (COF); Kramer thinks Capital One is a well-run company and a potential buy, but warns that the impact of regulatory changes is uncertain</li>
<li>Albert: Asked about Target (TGT) after its disappointing stock performance; Kramer thinks Target needs more excitement and scale in its food and delivery businesses, and suggests that investors look for signs of improvement in these areas</li>
<li>Rim: Asked about Rockwell Automation (ROK) as a robotics play; Kramer prefers Tesla (TSLA) for its robotics and AI capabilities, but notes that Rockwell Automation has a strong track record and is worth considering for investors interested in industrial automation</li>
<li>Steve: Asked about Reddit as a potential investment; Kramer thinks Reddit is a real company with growth potential, but prefers to wait for a pullback before considering an investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 3: Lightning Round</h2>
<ul>
<li>Answered quick questions from callers:
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey in Massachusetts: Asked about Waste Management (WM) vs. Waste Connections (WCN); Kramer prefers WM due to its stronger brand and more diversified business</li>
<li>Carl in California: Asked about Wendy's (WEN) with its 7% yield; Kramer is worried about Wendy's and thinks the high yield indicates underlying issues, suggesting that investors look for signs of improvement in the company's operations</li>
<li>David in Pennsylvania: Asked about Tetra Technologies (TTI); Kramer thinks the stock is too expensive after its 28% gain this year, and suggests that investors look for a pullback before considering an investment</li>
<li>And in Indiana: Asked about Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and its potential competition from smart rings; Kramer likes Abbott's growth prospects and thinks it's a great company, but notes that the impact of new technologies is uncertain</li>
<li>Jim in Texas: Asked about a fintech company; Kramer prefers to wait for SoFi's (SOFI) earnings report before considering an investment in the fintech space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 4: Texas Instruments Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discussed Texas Instruments (TXN), which fell 7.5% after disappointing earnings</li>
<li>Kramer thinks Texas Instruments is content with being the best in its niche but doesn't care about pleasing analysts or shareholders</li>
<li>Compares Texas Instruments to Micron (MU), which has successfully expanded into high-bandwidth memory chips for data centers</li>
<li>Kramer concludes that Texas Instruments doesn't seem to care about its shareholders, so there's no reason to own the stock unless you think it will go private or be acquired</li>
</ul>
