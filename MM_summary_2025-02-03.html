<h2>Tariffs and Trade with Mexico</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cramer discusses the tariffs on Mexico and how they may impact trade, noting that the tariffs could have a significant impact on many US companies that rely on imports from Mexico.</li>
<li>He notes that Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has been working with Trump to address immigration and fentanyl smuggling, and that this could potentially lead to a resolution to the trade dispute.</li>
