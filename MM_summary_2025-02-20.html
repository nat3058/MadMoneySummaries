<h2>Segment 3: Lightning Round</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Segment 4: On Holding Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cramer discussed the sneaker company On Holding, which has seen significant growth and popularity, driven by its strong brand and innovative products.</li>
<li>On Holding trades at 50 times earnings, which is very expensive, but Cramer notes that the company's growth prospects and strong brand justify a premium valuation.</li>

<li>He cautions that the athletic footwear and apparel industry is highly competitive and trends can change quickly, citing examples of companies like Under Armour and Foot Locker that have struggled in recent years.</li>
<li>Cramer also notes that On Holding's popularity is driven by its strong connection with consumers, particularly younger generations, and its ability to innovate and stay ahead of trends.</li>
