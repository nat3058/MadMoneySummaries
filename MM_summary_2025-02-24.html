<h2>Segment 3: Interview with Eric H. Sodia, CEO of AGCO</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Segment 4: Lightning Round</h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy Transfer (ET) is a smart buy due to its high yield, which provides a attractive income stream for investors.</li>
<li>New Fortress Energy is not a great company and has been previously profiled as such, due to concerns about its business model and financial performance.</li>
<li>Modine Manufacturing (MOD) has been dropping daily, but its yield makes it a potential buy, as the company's dividend payout provides a relatively stable source of income.</li>
<li>ELF Cosmetics (ELF) has been hated by the market, but its drop makes it a potential buy, as the company's strong brand and growing demand for cruelty-free and vegan cosmetics products could drive a rebound in its stock price.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segment 5: Faith in Well-Run Companies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jim Cramer emphasizes the importance of having faith in well-run companies like Apple and Home Depot, which have a proven track record of delivering strong financial performance and creating long-term value for shareholders.</li>
<li>Apple's announcement to spend over $500 billion in the US demonstrates its commitment to shareholders and its confidence in the US economy, which could drive a rebound in its stock price.</li>
<li>Home Depot's history of gaining share during downturns makes it a potential buy on weakness, as the company's strong brand and growing demand for home improvement products could drive a rebound in its stock price.</li>
<li>Cramer notes that investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals and a proven track record of delivering strong financial performance, rather than trying to time the market or make speculative bets on unproven companies.</li>
